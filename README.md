# Stair Congestion Monitor Application
Due to the dramatic rise in the number of students in SCIE in recent years, the level of congestion in staircases has also witnessed a sharp increase, resulting in safety concerns.
This project aims to alleviate this problem by providing students with means to visualize current level of congestion at staircases, therefore choosing routes more wisely.


# Quick start
The application is currently only available on Android, but supports for Apple will arrive soon by switching to Flutter.
The main page of the application contains a bar chart displaying the current level of congestion and a line chart to view the congestion level in the last few seconds.
